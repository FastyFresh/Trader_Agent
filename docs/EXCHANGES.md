     apiSecret: 'your-api-secret',
     passphrase: 'your-passphrase',
     useSandbox: true // for testing
   });
   ```

2. **Required Features:**

## Alternative Considerations

If Coinbase Futures doesn't meet our needs, Kraken would be the next best option, offering:

- Different API architecture

Both exchanges would require modifications to our current trading system, but the core strategy logic would remain the same.
